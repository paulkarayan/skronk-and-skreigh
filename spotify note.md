For full Spotify automation, we would need:

1. **Spotify Developer Account**: Register at https://developer.spotify.com/
2. **App Credentials**: Create an app to get Client ID and Client Secret
3. **Authentication**: OAuth2 flow to access your account
4. **Libraries**: `spotipy` Python library

To enable Spotify integration, you would provide:
- Spotify Client ID
- Spotify Client Secret
- Your Spotify username

The tool could then:
- Search for each tune on Spotify
- Create a new playlist
- Add tunes in the correct order
- Handle tunes not found on Spotify

Would you like me to add Spotify API integration?
